# Cloudformation

Deploying infrastructure in a consistent, reliable manner is difficult — it requires people to follow documented procedures without taking any undocumented shortcuts. Plus, it can be difficult to deploy infrastructure out-of-hours when less staff are available. AWS CloudFormation changes this by defining infrastructure in a template that can be automatically deployed — even on an automated schedule.
